Hanoi, Vietnam Travel Video Guide
Hanoi has a 1000 year history as a city. It has been invaded by the Chinese, French and Japanese. The French Colonial period in particular has had a noticeable influence on the aesthetics of the City. I visit a Bia Hoi Bar where I find relief from the constant rush and din. Lan, a student in International Relations, gives me a half day tour of Hanoi. We visit the flower market, watch people exercise around Hoan Kiem Lake, and visit Lan's favorite restaurant, Hai Vuong Quan.
